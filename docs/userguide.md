# Weemo Driver User Guide

## Overview

This document describes how to use the WeemoDriver (download, installation, start, stop and uninstall). 
Once you download and install the WeemoDriver, it is run at start-up time on your system and quietly runs in the background.

Sometimes, however, you may have a reason to stop the driver. Or you may want to force it to stop and restart.  Access to the control panel for the WeemoDriver is different on OS X and Windows.
